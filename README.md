# parse_url_params

## SUMMARY
This is a simple tool to extract the individual query string values (parameters) of a URL. This is meant for my own purposes, but you're welcome to use it yourself.

## INSTRUCTIONS
This is built entirely for the front end, so you can either browse to the deployed page or download this repository and open in your browser locally.

In the **INPUT** box, enter the URL containing the query string (preloaded with *https://example.com/page.php?url=http://www.example.test*) and then hit the **SUBMIT** button.  In the table below, the base URL and each key-value pair from the query string will be populated each in their own row.  For each query string value, a **COPY** button will appear in the table row that will, when clicked, will copy the value to the clipboard.

To clear the **INPUT** box and the table, click on the **RESET** button.  Focus will return to the **INPUT** box for a new URL.
